        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Solar PV Partners (SPVP) deliver improved financial and environmental
          performance with our partners in the education, energy, farming,
          retail, IT, manufacturing, government and distribution sectors. Our
          purpose is to improve energy independence and deploy sustatinable,
          renewable resources for the improvement of our environment. SPVP
          partners with companies in the UK/Ireland, Afghanistan, the Carribean,
          Czech Republic, Estonia, Kenya, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria,
          Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, UAE and the USA
          to install safe, non-toxic battery technology solutions with Solar PV
          systems, for both on-grid and off-grid locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We initially started the journey in 2012 with the goal of providing
          commercial Solar PV systems to Colleges and local governments, which
          we started in Hampshire, UK in 2013 with a 100kW system installation
          at Basingstoke College of Technolgy and then added storage
          technologies as part of our renewable energy system solutions. We
          spent nine months researching various battery chemistries and energy
          storage solutions. Energy storage system (ESS) installations began in
          2014 with the cleanest, safest battery available worldwide. SPVP were
          the first UK company to license the only Cradle to Cradle Certified
          battery from Aquion (the salt water battery) and were the largest
          distributor for both the residential and commercial markets; the first
          to install Simipli Phi Power batteries in the UK in 2017 and the first
          to trial the Alpha ESS Lithium Iron Phosphate LiFePO4 Storion SMILE5
          complete energy storage solution with a UK utility for residential
          applications in 2019.

          In 2015/2016 Solar PV Partners was the creator, architect, project
          facilitator and project manager for the largest Solar PV installation
          at any UK educational establishment, Sparsholt College, with 633kWp of
          Solar PV across 20 different rooftops. Sparsholt College will continue
          to benefit for the next two decades from very significant reductions
          in their reduced per kW hour rate of electricity through the Power
          Purchase Agreement arragned by SPVP.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, Solar PV Partners installed the first SimpliPhi Power Lithium
          Iron Phosphate LiFePO4 battery/energy storage system in a Winchester,
          UK home. SimpliPhi Power is one of the most robust, safest, longest
          life, low voltage Lithium battery solutions. The robustness of the
          Simpliphi battery was confirmed in stress testing against thirty other
          mostly well known battery brands; docuented by the US military in 3
          day stress tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, SPVPâ€™s subsdiary company shipped Simpliphi batteries to
          Nature Grid in Nigeria for use in Total petrol stations to replace
          diesel generators with Solar + Storage. LiFePo4 (non-cobalt) batteries
          were selected for their outstanding perfomance in hot climates and
          safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019, Alpha ESS, another outstanding LiFePO4 battery with a a
          sophisticated cloud control app, Alpha Cloud has become the low and
          high voltage residential/commercial/industrial SPVP partners for
          delivery of residential, commercial and multi-megawatt containerized
          solutions in the UK market. Solar PV Partners are now offering energy
          storage technology solutions for grid balancing solutions for Demand
          Side Response (DFR Scheme), STOR, peak shaving, on site consumption of
          renewables, uninterruped back-up power supply systems and energy
          market brokering. Solar PV Partners are working with partners and
          directly with customers in the UK/Ireland, Europe, Middle East,
          Mexico, the Caribbean, USA and across Africa for a variety of Solar PV
          plus Storage low/high voltage, on off-grid solutions. Solar PV
          Partners have become the first licensed UK distributor of Encell Fused
          Iron batteries. Contact us to discuss how to maximise renewable energy
          performance.
