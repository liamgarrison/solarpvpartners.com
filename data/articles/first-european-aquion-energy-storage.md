**Solar PV Partners Limited, the UK renewable energy resource management company, today announced the first UK/European combined solar and wind installation with a 25 kWh Aquion Energy battery system at Upperlands Farm in Northern Ireland, UK.**

Dennis Garrison, Managing Director of Solar PV Partners Ltd, a UK/European dealer of Aquion Energy storage systems, said:  “We are delighted to work with Wattstor, an innovative renewable energy  installation company on **the first Aquion Energy system installed in the UK and Europe for storing both solar and wind power.**  John Henderson of Henbo Energy had the vision to combine storage from two renewable energy sources at his Upperland Farm in Northern Ireland and decided on award-winning Aquion Energy batteries, combined with a Wattstor installation as the right solution”.

The renewable energy storage market is projected to grow at phenomenal rates over the next decade and **Aquion Energy is delivering batteries that provide an unmatched combination of safety, sustainability, long life and robust performance**.  Chancellor George Osborne supports the storage industry and recently stated that, “The UK must take a global lead in developing low carbon technologies, including electricity storage”, further saying 10,000 jobs could be created by generating 2,000 megawatts of storage by 2020.

**“This is an exciting time for both Wattstor and energy storage generally,” said Wattstor Director Michael Danes.** “The installation of sodium ion batteries is proof of our commitment to identifying and supplying renewable energy storage systems that are sustainable whilst also being economically viable. Providing batteries that offer strong performance, are safe and sustainable, and also offer a potential life span of fifteen years will remove the ethical dilemma posed by some of the more commonly available but less environmentally-friendly battery chemistries currently on the market”.

“In a sector that has seen a great deal of publicity about lithium ion and lead acid products, the arrival of a battery suitable for large domestic, small commercial, and agricultural customers that is completely non-toxic, contains no heavy metals, is non-flammable and non-acidic, presents renewable enthusiasts with a genuinely sustainable alternative to existing battery technologies”.

**Solar PV Partners** is an innovative renewable energy resource management group of partner companies, having recently facilitated finance and delivery of the largest school/college/university installation of Solar PV in the UK for Sparsholt College.  Solar PV Partners became one of the first UK/European dealers of Aquion Energy storage systems, beginning April of 2015.
